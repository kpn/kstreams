# Subscribe topics by pattern

In the following example we have a `Stream` that will consume from topics that match the regular expression `^local--customer-.*$`, for example
`local--customer-invoice` and `local--customer-profile`.

## Requirements

python 3.8+, poetry, docker-compose

### Installation

```bash
poetry install
```

## Usage

1. Start the kafka cluster: From `kstreams` project root execute `./scripts/cluster/start`
2. Inside this folder execute `poetry run app`

The app publishes events to the topics `local--customer-invoice` and `local--customer-profile`, then the events are consumed by the `stream` that has subscribed them using the pattern `^local--customer-.*$`.

You should see something similar to the following logs:

```bash
‚ùØ poetry run app

```

## Note

If you plan on using this example, pay attention to the `pyproject.toml` dependencies, where
`kstreams` is pointing to the parent folder. You will have to set the latest version.
