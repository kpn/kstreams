# Testing

To test `streams` and `producers` or perform `e2e` tests you can make use of the `test_utils.TestStreamClient`. The `TestStreamClient` can send events so you won't need to mock the `producer`.

## Using `TestStreamClient`

Import `TestStreamClient`.

Create a `TestStreamClient` by passing the **engine** instance to it.

Create functions with a name that starts with `test_` (this is standard `pytest` conventions).

Use the `TestStreamClient` object the same way as you do with `engine`.

Write simple `assert` statements with the standard Python expressions that you need to check (again, standard `pytest`).

## Example

Let's assume that you have the following code example. The goal is to store all the consumed events in an `EventStore` for future analysis.

```python
# example.py
import aiorun
import typing
from dataclasses import dataclass, field

from kstreams import ConsumerRecord, create_engine
from kstreams.streams import Stream

topic = "local--kstreams"

stream_engine = create_engine(title="my-stream-engine")


@dataclass
class EventStore:
    """
    Store events in memory
    """
    events: typing.List[ConsumerRecord] = field(default_factory=list)

    def add(self, event: ConsumerRecord) -> None:
        self.events.append(event)

    @property
    def total(self):
        return len(self.events)


event_store = EventStore()


@stream_engine.stream(topic, group_id="example-group")
async def consume(stream: Stream):
    async for cr in stream:
        event_store.add(cr)


async def produce():
    payload = b'{"message": "Hello world!"}'

    for _ in range(5):
        await stream_engine.send(topic, value=payload, key="1")
        await asyncio.sleep(2)


async def start():
    await stream_engine.start()
    await produce()


async def shutdown(loop):
    await stream_engine.stop()


def main():
    aiorun.run(start(), stop_on_unhandled_errors=True, shutdown_callback=shutdown)
```

Then you could have a `test_stream.py` file to test the code, you need to instanciate the `TestStreamClient` with the `engine`:

```python
# test_stream.py
import pytest
from kstreams.test_utils import TestStreamClient

from example import stream_engine, event_store

client = TestStreamClient(stream_engine)


@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_add_event_on_consume():
    """
    Produce some events and check that the EventStore is updated.
    """
    topic = "local--kstreams"  # Use the same topic as the stream
    event = b'{"message": "Hello world!"}'

    async with client:
        metadata = await client.send(topic, value=event, key="1")  # send the event with the test client
        current_offset = metadata.offset
        assert metadata.topic == topic

        # send another event and check that the offset was incremented
        metadata = await client.send(topic, value=b'{"message": "Hello world!"}', key="1")
        assert metadata.offset == current_offset + 1

    # check that the event_store has 2 events stored
    assert event_store.total == 2
```

!!! Note
    Notice that the `produce` coroutine is not used to send events in the test case.
    The `TestStreamClient.send` coroutine is used instead.
    This allows to test `streams` without having producer code in your application

### Testing the Commit

In some cases your stream will commit, in this situation checking the commited partitions can be useful.

```python
import pytest
from kstreams.test_utils import TestStreamClient

from .example import produce, stream_engine

topic_name = "local--kstreams-marcos"
value = b'{"message": "Hello world!"}'
name = "my-stream"
key = "1"
partition = 2
tp = structs.TopicPartition(
    topic=topic_name,
    partition=partition,
)
total_events = 10

@stream_engine.stream(topic_name, name=name)
async def my_stream(stream: Stream):
    async for cr in stream:
        # commit every time that an event arrives
        await stream.consumer.commit({tp: cr.offset})


# test the code
client = TestStreamClient(stream_engine)

@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_consumer_commit(stream_engine: StreamEngine):
    async with client:
        for _ in range(0, total_events):
            await client.send(topic_name, partition=partition, value=value, key=key)

        # check that everything was commited
        stream = stream_engine.get_stream(name)
        assert (await stream.consumer.committed(tp)) == total_events
```

### E2E test

In the previous code example the application produces to and consumes from the same topic, then `TestStreamClient.send` is not needed because the `engine.send` is producing. For those situation you can just use your `producer` code and check that certain code was called.

```python
# test_example.py
import pytest
from kstreams.test_utils import TestStreamClient

from .example import produce, stream_engine

client = TestStreamClient(stream_engine)


@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_e2e_example():
    """
    Test that events are produce by the engine and consumed by the streams
    """
    with patch("example.on_consume") as on_consume, patch("example.on_produce") as on_produce:
        async with client:
            await produce()

    on_produce.call_count == 5
    on_consume.call_count == 5
```

## Producer only

In some scenarios, your application will only produce events and other application/s will consume it, but you want to make sure that
the event was procuced in a proper way and the `topic` contains that `event`.

```python
# producer_example.py
from kstreams import create_engine
import aiorun
import asyncio

stream_engine = create_engine(title="my-stream-engine")


async def produce(topic: str, value: bytes, key: str):
    # This could be a complicated function or something like a FastAPI view
    await stream_engine.send(topic, value=value, key=key)


async def start():
    await stream_engine.start()
    await produce()


async def shutdown(loop):
    await stream_engine.stop()


def main():
    aiorun.run(start(), stop_on_unhandled_errors=True, shutdown_callback=shutdown)
```

Then you could have a `test_producer_example.py` file to test the code:

```python
# test_producer_example.py
import pytest
from kstreams.test_utils import TestStreamClient

from producer_example import stream_engine, produce

client = TestStreamClient(stream_engine)


@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_event_produced():
    topic_name = "local--kstreams"
    value = b'{"message": "Hello world!"}'
    key = "1"

    async with client:
        await produce(topic=topic_name ,value=value, key=key) # use the produce code to send events

        # check that the event was placed in a topic in a proper way
        consumer_record = await client.get_event(topic_name=topic_name)

        assert consumer_record.value == value
        assert consumer_record.key == key
```

!!! Note
    Even thought the previous example is using a simple `produce` function,
    it shows what to do when the `procuder code` is encapsulated in other functions,
    for example a `FastAPI` view.
    Then you don't want to use `client.send` directly, just called the function that contains `stream_engine.send(...)`
