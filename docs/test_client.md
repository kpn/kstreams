# Testing

To test your `streams` or perform `e2e` tests you can make use of the `test_utils.TestStreamClient`. The `TestStreamClient` also can send events so you won't need to mock the `producer`.

## Using `TestStreamClient`

Import `TestStreamClient`.

Create a `TestStreamClient` by passing the **engine** instance to it.

Create functions with a name that starts with `test_` (this is standard `pytest` conventions).

Use the `TestStreamClient` object the same way as you do with `engine`.

Write simple `assert` statements with the standard Python expressions that you need to check (again, standard `pytest`).

## Example

Let's assume that you have the following code example:

```python
# example.py
from kstreams import create_engine
import aiorun
import asyncio

topic = "local--kstreams"
stream_engine = create_engine(title="my-stream-engine")


def on_consume(value):
    print(f"Value {value} consumed")
    return value


def on_produce(metadata):
    print(f"Metadata {metadata} sent")
    return metadata


@stream_engine.stream(topic, group_id="example-group")
async def consume(stream: Stream):
    async for cr in stream:
        print(f"Event consumed: headers: {cr.headers}, payload: {cr.value}")
        on_consume(value)


async def produce():
    payload = b'{"message": "Hello world!"}'

    for _ in range(5):
        metadata = await stream_engine.send(topic, value=payload, key="1")
        print(f"Message sent: {metadata}")
        on_produce(metadata)


async def start():
    await stream_engine.start()
    await produce()


async def shutdown(loop):
    await stream_engine.stop()


def main():
    aiorun.run(start(), stop_on_unhandled_errors=True, shutdown_callback=shutdown)

```

Then you could have a `test_stream.py` file to test the code, you need to instanciate the `TestStreamClient` with the `engine`:

```python
# test_stream.py
import pytest
from kstreams.test_utils import TestStreamClient

from example import stream_engine

client = TestStreamClient(stream_engine)


@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_streams_consume_events():
    topic = "local--kstreams"  # Use the same topic as the stream
    event = b'{"message": "Hello world!"}'

    with patch("example.on_consume") as on_consume:
        async with client:
            metadata = await client.send(topic, value=event, key="1")  # send the event with the test client
            current_offset = metadata.offset
            assert metadata.topic == topic

            # send another event and check that the offset was incremented
            metadata = await client.send(topic, value=b'{"message": "Hello world!"}', key="1")
            assert metadata.offset == current_offset + 1

    # check that the event was consumed
    on_consume.assert_called()
```

### E2E test

```python
# test_example.py
import pytest
from kstreams.test_utils import TestStreamClient

from .example import produce, stream_engine

client = TestStreamClient(stream_engine)


@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_e2e_example():
    """
    Test that events are produce by the engine and consumed by the streams
    """
    with patch("example.on_consume") as on_consume, patch("example.on_produce") as on_produce:
        async with client:
            await produce()

    on_produce.call_count == 5
    on_consume.call_count == 5
```
