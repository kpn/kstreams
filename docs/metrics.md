Metrics are generated by [prometheus_client](https://github.com/prometheus/client_python). You must be responsable of setting up a `webserver` to expose the `metrics`.

## Metrics

### Producer

* `topic_partition_offsets`: `Gauge` of offsets per `topic/partition`

### Consumer

* `consumer_committed`: `Gauge` of consumer commited per `topic/partition` in a `consumer group`
* `consumer_position`: `Gauge` of consumer `current position` per `topic/partition` in a `consumer group`
* `consumer_highwater`: `Gauge` of consumer `highwater` per `topic/partition` in a `consumer group`
* `consumer_lag`: `Gauge` of current consumer `lag` per `topic/partition` in a `consumer group` calculated with the last commited offset
* `position_lag`: `Gauge` of current consumer `position_lag` per `topic/partition` in a `consumer group` calculated using the consumer position
