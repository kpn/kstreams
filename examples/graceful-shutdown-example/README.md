# Graceful Shutdown Example

The idea is to demostrate that a `Graceful Shutdown` is possbile when a stream crashes. In this example we have two streams, one consuming from `local--hello-world`
topic and the other one consuming from `local--kstream`.

The stream consuming from `local--kstream` has a delay of 20 seconds after an `event` is received (this is to simulate a super slow consumption process).
The stream consuming from `local--hello-world` will raise a `ValueError("error....")` exception when the event value is `error`.
If an event was send to `local--kstream` in a time `t` and later an event with the value `error` was send to `local--hello-world` in a windows of less than `20 seconds`, then the stoping program process will be delay `20 seconds - t seconds`

Example:

1. Send an event to topic `local--kstream` now
2. Send an event to topic `local--hello-world` 5 seconds after sending the event in the previous step
3. You will see that after `15 seconds` the program stops, because it must wait that the event on `step 1` is processed.

## Requirements

python 3.8+, poetry, docker-compose

### Installation

```bash
poetry install
```

## Usage

1. Start the kafka cluster: From `kstreams` project root execute `./scripts/cluster/start`
2. Inside this folder execute `poetry run app`
3. From `kstreams` project root, you can use the `./scripts/cluster/events/send` to send events to the kafka cluster. A prompt will open. Enter messages to send. The command is:
```bash
./scripts/cluster/events/send "local--kstream"
```
Then, on the consume side, you should see something similar to the following logs:

```bash
‚ùØ me@me-pc simple-consumer-example % poetry run app

Group Coordinator Request failed: [Error 15] CoordinatorNotAvailableError
Group Coordinator Request failed: [Error 15] CoordinatorNotAvailableError
Group Coordinator Request failed: [Error 15] CoordinatorNotAvailableError
Group Coordinator Request failed: [Error 15] CoordinatorNotAvailableError
Group Coordinator Request failed: [Error 15] CoordinatorNotAvailableError
Consumer started
Event consumed: headers: (), payload: ConsumerRecord(topic='local--hello-world', partition=0, offset=0, timestamp=1660733921761, timestamp_type=0, key=None, value=b'boo', checksum=None, serialized_key_size=-1, serialized_value_size=3, headers=())
```
4. In another terminal repeat the same to send events to the other topic and send the event `error`
```bash
./scripts/cluster/events/send "local--hello-world"
```
5. Then, on the consume side, you should see something similar to the following logs:
```bash

## Note

If you plan on using this example, pay attention to the `pyproject.toml` dependencies, where
`kstreams` is pointing to the parent folder. You will have to set the latest version.
